### 1. WWW vs Internet
- What problems we had in the past
- We found solutions to thoese problems and we are at now

#### Tim Berners-Lee
  - invented the World Wide Web in 1898
  - first web developer
  - create the first browser and the first server in 1991
  - created this ability for people to communicate and link to other documents
#### World Wide Web(WWW)
  - essentially a common language that computers can speak
  - Internet as your phone and the World Wide Web is Instagram that runs on your phone 
  - essentially a decentralized application

### 2. HTML, CSS, Javascript
- HTML: a way for us to write text on websites and these text on web sites can also theses things called hyperlinks that can link to other parts of the website.
- In 1991, we had a way for us to share documents and this can link to another website, another file, another research paper. But it wasn't prettiest(problem)
- In 1995-1996, two techonologies -> CSS and Javascript
- CSS: visual aspects we can toy around with website, make it look pretty
- Javascript: can do all these interactive things (ex)click, put credit card ... etc with website
- basic HTML file to add some CSS, and Javascript

  - with Developer Tool(개발자도구) 이것저것 해보기

### 3. Developer Fundamentals: Ⅱ
  - multiple web browsers -> Chrome,IE,Firefox,Safari..etc
  - need to create different files specific for each browser
  - 'The browser wars' where each browser was kind of doing its own thing implementing different things
  - mobile phones, iPads ...
  - 어느 환경에서든 웹 사이트를 볼 수 있어야 한다.(고민점)
